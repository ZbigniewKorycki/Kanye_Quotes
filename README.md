<h1>Kanye Quotes Generator</h1>

This Python script and Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI) create a simple application that fetches and displays quotes from Kanye West. The app allows users to click a button to get a new quote from Kanye and displays it on the screen. 

The project was done as part of the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) - Day 33.
